I"><p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code>YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code>MONTH</code> and <code>DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code>MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>##Preamble</p>

<p>All right dudes and dudettes, today we’ll take a brief look at a mysterious, useful, and vaguely functional programming-ish feature of Python: generators!
Let’s start with a definition: a generator is a function that returns an iterator. The iterator is a separate topic by itself, but to get a cursory understanding of generators, you really only need to know three things about it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>it’s an object which can be iterated upon, much like a list</li>
  <li>therefore, it can be used in loops</li>
  <li>to get the next piece item from an iterator, you can call <code>next(iterator)</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>With that out of the way, let’s discuss generators.</p>

<p>##How generators work?
Normally, when a function is called, it returns some value, then stops executing[1]. 
Generators circumvent this behavior, working kind of like a deep freezer: when used, they ‘freeze’ the state of the function, so when it returns something, its execution doesn’t stop: you can do whatever with the returned value, then get back to the ‘frozen’ state, and get the next value from it, and the next, and the next, until it runs out… or not (more on that later).</p>

<p>##Syntax
It’s simple, really: instead of <code>return</code>, use <code>yield</code> in your function, and voilá - you created a generator function![2] [3] 
It helps if you think of <code>yield</code> as a <code>return</code> statement, after which you can jump back to where you were in the function.</p>

<p>##Use case
Now that we mentioned iterators, a very obvious use case for generators is when we need a sequence of values - especially so when the sequence has to be infinite. 
But instead of a lengthy discussion, I think the concept is best explained through…</p>

<p>##Contrived code examples
Let’s say that you are assigned to the engineer crew of a New Order star destroyer. One day, you are tasked with writing a brand new software to replace the out of date controls of the plasma cannons. You enthusiastically take up the challenge, starting with trying to make the damn thing fire actual plasma beams. 
You come up with this code pretty quickly:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">StarDestroyer</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">blast</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"POW!"</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fire_plasma_cannon</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">blast</span>

<span class="n">star_destroyer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StarDestroyer</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When you call <code>print(star_destroyer.fire_plasma_cannon(), end=" ")</code> to test it, however, you get this result:</p>

<p><code>$ POW!</code></p>

<p>Your supervisor obviously won’t be happy with that: though the cannon works perfectly, it only fires one beam at a time, which won’t be enough to deal with those pesky rebels - also, you don’t want the gun crew to all get tendonitis from repeatedly mashing the fire button during a space battle, do you? So you refactor the code to look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">StarDestroyer</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">blast</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"POW!"</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fire_plasma_cannon</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">blast</span>

<span class="n">star_destroyer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">StarDestroyer</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre></figure>
