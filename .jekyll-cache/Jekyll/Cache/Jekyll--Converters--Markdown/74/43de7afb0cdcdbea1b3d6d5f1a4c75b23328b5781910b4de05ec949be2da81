I"ï<p>Youâ€™ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code>YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code>MONTH</code> and <code>DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code>MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>##Preamble</p>

<p>All right dudes and dudettes, today weâ€™ll take a brief look at a mysterious, useful, and vaguely functional programming-ish feature of Python: generators!
Letâ€™s start with a definition: a generator is a function that returns an iterator. The iterator is a separate topic by itself, but to get a cursory understanding of generators, you really only need to know three things about it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>itâ€™s an object which can be iterated upon, much like a list</li>
  <li>therefore, it can be used in loops</li>
  <li>to get the next piece item from an iterator, you can call <code>next(iterator)</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>With that out of the way, letâ€™s discuss generators.</p>

<p>##How generators work?
Normally, when a function is called, it returns some value, then stops executing[1]. 
Generators circumvent this behavior, working kind of like a deep freezer: when used, they â€˜freezeâ€™ the state of the function, so when it returns something, its execution doesnâ€™t stop: you can do whatever with the returned value, then get back to the â€˜frozenâ€™ state, and get the next value from it, and the next, and the next, until it runs outâ€¦ or not (more on that later).</p>

<p>##Syntax
Itâ€™s simple, really: instead of <code>return</code>, use <code>yield</code> in your function, and voilÃ¡ - you created a generator function![2] [3] 
It helps if you think of <code>yield</code> as a <code>return</code> statement, after which you can jump back to where you were in the function.</p>
